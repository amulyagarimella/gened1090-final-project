description: Refreshment for the Brain
---
<span className="cap">AT</span> early dawn, when first from bed you rise,

Wash, in cold water, both your hands and eyes.

With comb and brush then cleanse your teeth and hair,

And thus refreshed, your limbs outstretch with care.

Such things restore the weary, Vertasked brain ;

And to all parts ensure a wholesome gain.

Fresh from the bath get warm. Rest after food,

Or walk, as seems most suited to your mood.

But in whate'er engaged, or sport, or feat,

Cool not too soon the body when in heat.

## Recreation for the Sight.

Groves, Brooks and Verdure, weary eyes relieve,

At dawn, seek Mountains, Streams at dusky eve.
