<span className="cap">THIS</span> text was created at the Medical School of Salerno.

It was translated from Latin into English by John Ordronaux.

It was bound in this digital codex by Amulya Garimella, based on Fumadocs.

The Regimen font was designed based on the hand of scribes who transcribed this for Arnaldus de Villanova around 1480. Joannes de Mediolano may have been involved in creating the text. Amulya Garimella digitized this into a font via hand-tracing.

This digital codex also makes use of the Tagesschrift font by Yanone.

May it bring you good health.
