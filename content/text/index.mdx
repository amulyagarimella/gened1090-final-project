## Code of the School of Salernum

<span className="cap">SALERNO'S SCHOOL</span>, in conclave high, unites

Lo counsel England's King, and thus indites:

If thou to health and vigor wouldst attain,

Shun weighty caresâ€”all anger deem profane,

From heavy suppers and much wine abstain.

Nor trivial count it, after pompous fare,

To rise from table and to take the air.

Shun idle, noonday slumber, nor delay

The urgent calls of Nature to obey.

These rules if thou wilt follow to the end,

Thy life to greater length thou mayst extend.
