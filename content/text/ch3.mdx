description: Of Noontide Sleep.

<span className="cap">LET</span> noontide sleep be brief, or none at all ;

Else stupor, headache, fever, rheums will fall

On him who yields to noontide's drowsy call.

Perchance, should some one crave a midday nap

From habitâ€”then, t'will cause him less mishap.

But let none sleep soon after having fed,

Nor long, and always with uplifted head.

To point these rules, t'is fitting to rehearse,

To him who sleeps, this rude, untutored verse :

Post-praridial sleep, ye mortals, put afar,

In any month whose name includes an R.

Post-prandial sleep 's alone salubrious,

In months, whose names their ending have in US.
